The current working directory is already provisioned by the benchmark host at exactly the task base commit, with one reachable commit and no Git remotes. Work only in this isolated local source tree.

Do not add Git remotes, clone, fetch, or pull. Do not access GitHub, GitHub APIs, upstream pull requests, commits, patches, or issue solutions. Do not use curl/wget or web-search tools. The benchmark runtime blocks outbound tools and commands.

Fix the issue using only the problem statement and the isolated local source tree. Generate sveltejs__svelte-3403.patch from the git diff,verify that git diff sveltejs__svelte-3403.patch contains only implementation or production files and no test files or test artifacts and then place it at this exact path: /Users/sankanum1/Documents/SWEPolyBenchRuns/R2VerifiedGPT5.6Sol/running-env/swe-results/sveltejs__svelte-3403.patch.

Problem: SVG elements in  not rendered as SVG elements
**Describe the bug**
I have a component that is basically an `` with a `` the idea being that it's easy to pass some svg tags to the component and have them all rendered the same. This works fine as long as the SVG is passed as an HTML string. `{@html ''}` but if it's passed as an element, it no longer works.

This doesn't work:
```html

```

This does work:
```html

    {@html ''}

```

**To Reproduce**

Icon component
```html

```

**Expected behavior**
SVG elements should be rendered as SVG.

**Information about your Svelte project:**
- Tested on Chrome 76
- MacOS Mojave
- Svelte version 3.6.10
- Rollup

**Severity**
Annoying, results in less readable code. Also, I wonder if this impacts the binary size in any way.

I suspect this issue is related, but was closed.

## Agent Execution Steps

1. **Tool call: register_tools**
Input:
```json
{
  "tool_names": [
    "get_agent_memory",
    "read_file",
    "get_workspace_files_list",
    "grep",
    "run_terminal_command",
    "edit_file",
    "write_file",
    "get_enriched_prompt",
    "add_agent_memory"
  ],
  "toolPurpose": "- I want to inspect the isolated Svelte repository and required `.env` context, understand the compiler behavior, implement and validate the production-only fix, generate the requested patch, and retain concise task learnings."
}
```
Output:
```
Tools [get_agent_memory, read_file, get_workspace_files_list, grep, run_terminal_command, edit_file, write_file, get_enriched_prompt, add_agent_memory] are now registered and immediately available for usage.
```

2. **Tool call: get_agent_memory**
Input:
```json
{
  "toolPurpose": "- I want to read prior agent context and persistent workspace learnings before inspecting or changing the repository, so I can avoid duplicate work and honor established project conventions."
}
```
Output:
```
Successfully read agent memory content:
Learnings from previous agent sessions: Successfully loaded 103 memory entries. Use these to inform your work and avoid creating duplicate memories when calling `add_agent_memory` tool.
Loaded memories:
* Gson JsonReader reports malformed Unicode escapes through syntaxError, yielding MalformedJsonException with line, column, and JSON path context.
* Gson Excluder handles anonymous/non-static local classes directionally: serialization delegates normally, while deserialization remains excluded.
* RocketMQ consumer lag, inflight, and available-message aggregates must iterate TopicConfig read queues to match consumer progress semantics.
* Dubbo's MulticastRegistry.java uses CRLF; validate its diffs with Git core.whitespace=cr-at-eol to avoid false trailing-whitespace failures.
* Gson tests on JDK 26 need -Pjdk15, release 8, ProGuard skipped, and ReflectionAccessTest excluded due removed SecurityManager support.
* Apollo namespace validation rejects URI-reserved names `.` and `..` while allowing ordinary dotted names.
* Gson production links to repository documentation should use the `main` branch in GitHub blob URLs.
* Gson ISO8601Utils uses a separate date-only GregorianCalendar path; it must disable leniency just like the date-time path to reject impossible dates.
* Apollo Portal password fragments are configured by apollo.portal.auth.password-checker.commonly-used-passwords-file and re-read on each check.
* Gson JsonWriter.name must immediately reject calls outside EMPTY_OBJECT or NONEMPTY_OBJECT with IllegalStateException("Nesting problem.").
* Dubbo RpcUtils priority is method-specific invocation attachment, generic attachment, URL method config, then URL global config.
* Gson ConstructorConstructor special-cases EnumMap, constructing it from a parameterized Class key and rejecting invalid raw/non-Class key types.
* Gson's unsafe opt-out API is disableJdkUnsafe(); its state must survive Gson.newBuilder() and fail lazily with JsonIOException when no constructor exists.
* Gson's JsonAdapter annotation factory must precede collection and map factories so unregistered annotation factories can obtain those delegates.
* Gson Streams.AppendableWriter.CurrentWrite must override toString() to return its full backing char array for CharSequence-compliant Appendables.
* Gson FormattingStyle separator spacing uses withSpaceAfterSeparators(boolean) and usesSpaceAfterSeparators(); commas are spaced only when newline is empty.
* Dubbo ClassHelper.convertPrimitive returns null for null or empty string input before primitive parsing.
* Gson Maven on JDK 26 fails -Werror on $Gson$Types dangling doc comments; direct javac --release 8 can validate production compilation locally.
* Gson serializes LazilyParsedNumber via an exact built-in adapter registered before reflective fallback, preserving its numeric lexeme.
* Guava concurrency production changes often require mirrored edits in guava/src and android/guava/src.
* Gson JsonObject backs members with LinkedTreeMap configured to reject Java null values, including through Map.Entry.setValue.
* Gson ProtoTypeAdapter supports opt-in explicit protobuf json_name via setShouldUseJsonNameFieldOption; custom serialized-name extensions take precedence.
* Apollo Portal forbids creating a private AppNamespace when the same name is already a globally public AppNamespace.
* Gson primitive numeric adapters must call the matching Number conversion method before serialization, including float/double and long-string policy wrappers.
* Dubbo compatibility tests on JDK 26 need JaCoCo skipped and java.lang opened; full tests may still fail when sandbox socket binding is denied.
* RocketMQ broker send ingress must strip PROPERTY_POP_CK so forwarded POP messages receive a fresh destination-broker receipt handle.
* Guava TopKSelector's trim fallback sorts an inclusive [left, right] range, so Arrays.sort must receive right + 1 as its exclusive bound.
* Gson DefaultDateTypeAdapter must restore each cached DateFormat timezone in a finally block after every parse attempt.
* Dubbo MockInvoker caches must include the service interface in the key; shorthand mock values like true/default are shared across references.
* At Gson base fe30b85, Gson.newJsonWriter must call setHtmlSafe(htmlSafe) so adapter-driven integrations inherit default or disabled HTML escaping.
* Gson's Troubleshooting.md uses CRLF; run Git whitespace checks with core.whitespace=cr-at-eol.
* Apollo Portal local user administration uses a super-admin /users/admin endpoint and UserInfo.enabled; edits preserve blank passwords and persist enabled status.
* RocketMQ POP retry topic v2 uses `%RETRY%group+topic`; `+` is forbidden in topic/group names, while v1 uses `_`.
* Dubbo CompatibleTypeUtils parses LocalDateTime as yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss, LocalDate as yyyy-MM-dd, and LocalTime as HH:mm:ss.
* Dubbo Bytes char[] Base64 decoding must decrement full quartets and set remainder to 2/3 when the final quartet contains padding.
* Dubbo Triple Connection must assign the successful ChannelFuture channel in ConnectionListener before immediate availability checks.
* This Dubbo base contains multiple CRLF Java files; use git -c core.whitespace=cr-at-eol diff --check for rename-only patches.
* RocketMQ TieredFlatFile LOWER time lookup selects earliest segment with maxTimestamp >= target; UPPER selects latest with minTimestamp  instances, from shadowing it.
* Three.js Quaternion and Euler rotation-matrix conversion uses a 3-column stride for Matrix3 and 4-column stride for Matrix4 column-major elements.
* Svelte 1.17 static each-else teardown must set the destroyed else block reference to null so later empty states recreate it.
* Svelte v1 input value generation may tolerate dynamic type attributes, while binding semantics still require a compile-time static input type.
* At Svelte 1.14.1 base ec543cf, missing expected data properties are emitted by src/generators/dom/index.js as dev-only generated constructor diagnostics.
* Svelte v1 CSS attribute-presence selectors must return true once the attribute exists, before looking up a matcher operator.
* Svelte v1 component binding observers in keyed each blocks must reconstruct used contextual values from the child component's current _context before setting parent state.
* Svelte 1.27 CSS preprocessing is centralized in Stylesheet.apply for both DOM and SSR native elements, before selector matching and code generation.
* Svelte v1 Generator.parseJs must preserve node.async when lifting function expressions and arrow functions into named declarations.
* RocketMQ QueueOffsetAssigner uses get-before-computeIfAbsent fast paths to avoid Java 8 JDK-8161372 contention for established queue keys.
* Dubbo AbstractConfig metadata must prefer getX over duplicate isX accessors because Class.getMethods order is unspecified.
* Trino AddLocalExchanges should propagate parent stream preferences through identity projects to avoid redundant local repartition/gather exchanges around pruning.
* This benchmark workspace has no locally installed Java runtime, so Maven tests cannot run.
* In this Trino base, ProjectNode.isIdentity also identifies symbol-preserving pruning because Assignments checks only retained output assignments.
* Svelte v1 SSR must initialize a component-defined store inside `_render`, because nested components bypass the public `render` wrapper.
* Svelte v1 event handlers must serialize await contexts directly; each contexts instead serialize list/index pairs for reconstruction.
* Svelte v1 SVG attribute casing warnings are implemented in src/validate/html/validateElement.ts and scoped to SVG elements, descendants, and SVG namespace builds.
* Svelte v1 oncreate callbacks use unshift registration with LIFO callAll draining to preserve component/template preorder.
* Svelte v1 CSS scoping must merge the generated scope class into static and dynamic class values across DOM, innerHTML, and SSR output.
* Svelte v1 await then/catch context aliases must use Block.getUniqueName so names like children cannot shadow hydration helpers.
* Svelte v1 static innerHTML attribute serialization must join all text chunks so appended scoped CSS classes are not dropped on nested elements.
* Svelte v1 CSS DCE must treat Spread attributes as potential sources of any missing class, ID, or attribute during selector matching.
* Svelte v2 custom DOM event handlers must rewrite a direct `this.method()` callee to the associated element variable; native events retain runtime `this` binding.
* Svelte v3 alpha native element binding handlers emitted in component.partly_hoisted must use component.getUniqueName, not block.getUniqueName.
* Svelte v3 alpha rewrite_props must add a semicolon when exported prop declarations rely on ASI, while preserving an existing declaration semicolon.
* Svelte assignment instrumentation must ignore member roots that are not Identifiers; ThisExpression roots otherwise emit $$invalidate('undefined', undefined).
* Svelte v3 file-input bindings should listen to `change`, not `input`, because Safari does not reliably emit `input` when files are selected.
* Svelte v3 Expression.render must prefix hoisted object-method replacements with `: ` when the parent Property has method=true.
* Svelte v3 SSR inline-component attributes must use quote_name_if_necessary in both direct props and Object.assign spread fragments.
* When redirecting RTK git diff to a patch file, use --no-compact; compacted output can omit headers and produce an invalid patch.
* RTK git diff redirected to a file may omit the final newline; validate with git apply --check and regenerate with direct git diff if corrupt.
* A timed-out RTK git clone may leave a child process running; verify HEAD again before patch generation and reset to the requested base if it moved.
* After cherry-pick --no-commit, use git reset and git add -N for new files so plain git diff captures the complete patch.
* When creating a nested Git repo inside another repo, run `git init` with the nested absolute path to avoid reinitializing the parent repository.

25. **Tool call: add_agent_memory**
Input:
```json
{
  "memories": [
    {
      "content": "Svelte v3 Element namespace inference must stop at InlineComponent boundaries so slotted SVG tags do not inherit an outer HTML element namespace.",
      "scope": "workspace"
    }
  ],
  "toolPurpose": "- I want to preserve the project-specific compiler rule discovered here because it will help future Svelte namespace and slot fixes avoid crossing component boundaries."
}
```
Output:
```
Processed 1 memory item(s): 1 stored, 0 skipped (duplicates), 0 failed.
```

## Final Response

## Fix

Updated SVG namespace inference to stop at component boundaries. Slotted SVG tags such as `` now use the SVG namespace instead of inheriting an outer HTML element’s namespace.

## Validation

- Patch applies cleanly against the base index.
- Reverse application against the working tree succeeds.
- Whitespace validation passed.
- Diff contains one production compiler file only.
- No tests or test artifacts are included.
- Build/lint could not run because dependencies were unavailable in the local npm cache and outbound access is prohibited.
