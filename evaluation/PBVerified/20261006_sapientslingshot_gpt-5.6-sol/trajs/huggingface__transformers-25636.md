Problem: Problem caused by boolean attention mask in `pretrained_model.generate` of Flax GPT2
Hi! 

I notice that the usage of a boolean attention mask in `pretrained_model.generate` of Flax GPT2 can cause an error. Here is a short, self-contained code block to showcase the problem; I also prepared a [colab notebook here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fIfOr0AFfWlAho1dwuk8zqxKxlKmzd7i?usp=sharing):

``` python
import transformers
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
  "gpt2", padding_side="right")
tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token
query = jnp.array([
    [tokenizer.pad_token_id, tokenizer.pad_token_id, 23073],
])

response_length = 4
# temperature = 0.7
pretrained_model = transformers.FlaxAutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
generation_config = transformers.GenerationConfig(
    max_new_tokens=response_length,
    min_new_tokens=response_length,
    do_sample=True,
)
generation_config.pad_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id

context_length = query.shape[1]
attention_mask = query != tokenizer.pad_token_id

input_ids = query.clone()

# set padding tokens to 0
input_ids = jnp.where(attention_mask, input_ids, 0)
output = pretrained_model.generate(
    input_ids=input_ids,
    attention_mask=attention_mask,
    generation_config=generation_config,
)

# TypeError: lax.dynamic_update_slice requires arguments to have the same dtypes, got int32, bool.
```

The type error occurs because the `attention_mask` in our example above is a boolean array. But the `extended_attention_mask` used in [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/gpt2/modeling_flax_gpt2.py#L753) internally for response generation has an integer type. This leads to an error in the `lax.dynamic_update_slice` [line here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/gpt2/modeling_flax_gpt2.py#L756), as it can't handle inputs with different data types (integer and boolean).

I think this can be a bug, because boolean attention mask should be permitted.
To fix it, one can simply update [this line](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/gpt2/modeling_flax_gpt2.py#L756) in `transformers.models.gpt2.modelling_flax_gpt2.py`, which currently reads
`extended_attention_mask = lax.dynamic_update_slice(extended_attention_mask, attention_mask, (0, 0))`
into the following new line:
`extended_attention_mask = lax.dynamic_update_slice(extended_attention_mask, attention_mask.astype("i4"), (0, 0))`
This will correct the mismatch in dtypes. 

Happy to submit a PR for that!

### Who can help?

### Information

- [ ] The official example scripts
- [X] My own modified scripts

### Tasks

- [ ] An officially supported task in the `examples` folder (such as GLUE/SQuAD, ...)
- [X] My own task or dataset (give details below)

### Reproduction

Here is a short, self-contained code block to showcase the problem; I also prepared a [colab notebook here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fIfOr0AFfWlAho1dwuk8zqxKxlKmzd7i?usp=sharing):

``` python
import torch
import transformers
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
  "gpt2", padding_side="right")
tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token
query = jnp.array([
    [tokenizer.pad_token_id, tokenizer.pad_token_id, 23073],
])

response_length = 4
# temperature = 0.7
pretrained_model = transformers.FlaxAutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
generation_config = transformers.GenerationConfig(
    max_new_tokens=response_length,
    min_new_tokens=response_length,
    do_sample=True,
)
generation_config.pad_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id

context_length = query.shape[1]
attention_mask = query != tokenizer.pad_token_id

input_ids = query.clone()

# set padding tokens to 0
input_ids = jnp.where(attention_mask, input_ids, 0)
output = pretrained_model.generate(
    input_ids=input_ids,
    attention_mask=attention_mask,
    generation_config=generation_config,
)
# TypeError: lax.dynamic_update_slice requires arguments to have the same dtypes, got int32, bool.
```

### Expected behavior

I expected to execute the line `output = pretrained_model.generate(
    input_ids=input_ids,
    attention_mask=attention_mask,
    generation_config=generation_config,
)` in the above example, when `attention_mask` is a boolean mask.

## Agent Execution Steps

1. **Tool call: register_tools**
Input:
```json
{
  "tool_names": [
    "get_agent_memory",
    "get_workspace_files_list",
    "grep",
    "read_file",
    "edit_file",
    "run_terminal_command",
    "get_enriched_prompt",
    "add_agent_memory"
  ],
  "toolPurpose": "- I want to inspect the isolated repository and prior context, verify the exact Flax GPT-2 implementation contract, make the minimal production-only fix, run local validation, and generate the required patch artifact without network access."
}
```
Output:
```
Tools [get_agent_memory, get_workspace_files_list, grep, read_file, edit_file, run_terminal_command, get_enriched_prompt, add_agent_memory] are now registered and immediately available for usage.
```

2. **Tool call: get_agent_memory**
Input:
```json
{
  "toolPurpose": "- I want to read prior agent context and persistent repository learnings before inspecting or changing the isolated source tree, so I avoid duplicate work and respect established conventions."
}
```
Output:
```
Successfully read agent memory content:
Learnings from previous agent sessions: Successfully loaded 64 memory entries. Use these to inform your work and avoid creating duplicate memories when calling `add_agent_memory` tool.
Loaded memories:
* Autocomplete freeSolo text is preserved on blur by skipping input reset effects when the selected value has not changed.
* MUI system spacing keys are synchronized across spacing.js, spacing.d.ts, and Box/Box.d.ts.
* This benchmark workspace lacks node_modules, and Corepack selects Yarn 4, which cannot use the repository's Yarn 1 lockfile without installation.
* Material UI Stepper defaults to ol and Step defaults to li; both expose typed component overrides via OverridableComponent.
* MUI Base listbox and select onChange callbacks use event-first signatures, with null for programmatic changes and selected value second.
* FormControlLabel resolves `required` from its prop before the control prop and exposes required/asterisk utility classes.
* MUI DialogTitle must prefer its explicit id prop over the Dialog context titleId, while retaining titleId as the fallback.
* Material Autocomplete renderOption receives ownerState as its fourth argument; ownerState includes the resolved getOptionLabel callback.
* MUI Base and Joy Slider must consume aria-labelledby before root prop forwarding and pass it explicitly to useSlider for hidden inputs.
* Generated docs sandboxes load Material Icons and Material Icons Two Tone from the shared CreateReactApp HTML template.
* MUI responsiveFontSizes skips falsy typography styles so variants disabled with undefined are ignored safely.
* MuiTabs passes ownerState to its styled ScrollbarSize slot so functional theme overrides can safely inspect Tabs state.
* Tailwind core plugin configuration supports an `only` array that acts as an explicit allow-list while preserving existing false-based disabling.
* Tailwind flex utility definitions are centralized in src/generators/flex.js in this workspace.
* This code-server project configures Unix socket permissions with the string-valued --socket-mode option and removes sockets during app disposal.
* code-server's IPC registry path must stay synchronized between src/node/vscodeSocket.ts and both constructions in patches/store-socket.diff.
* Transformer-XL LM head uses shifted labels and hidden states, returning unreduced loss shaped batch_size by sequence_length minus one.
* AutoGPT list_files prunes hidden directories in-place during os.walk to exclude metadata trees such as .git from command output.
* Default data collator omits labels when first feature has label or label_ids set to None, enabling unlabeled prediction batches.
* This transformers workspace lacks sentencepiece and sacremoses, so mBART tests require dependency stubs or a provisioned test environment.
* The benchmark sandbox blocks pytest-rerunfailures from opening its localhost status socket; disable the plugin with -p no:rerunfailures.
* Transformer-XL adaptive vocabulary resizing must rebuild input and softmax partitions, preserve retained rows, update cutoffs, and restore ties.
* Benchmark options use positive fields inference, cuda, tpu, speed, memory, env_print, and multi_process, all defaulting to true.
* T5Tokenizer.prepare_seq2seq_batch must leave target labels unprefixed; model _shift_right adds the decoder-start pad token.
* Funnel mixed-precision attention promotes projected query, key, and value tensors to fp32 before einsum with fp32 relative-attention parameters.
* Focused pytest collection is blocked because installed datasets expects pyarrow.json_ and the installed pyarrow does not provide it.
* Longformer output_attentions returns local attentions in attentions and global-query probabilities in global_attentions for PyTorch and TensorFlow.
* Trainer checkpoint resume converts optimizer global steps to skipped dataloader batches by multiplying the epoch remainder by gradient accumulation steps.
* ProphetNet disabled n-gram targets use -100 and both LM loss paths use mean NLL reduction to match CrossEntropyLoss.
* Trainer.train treats resume_from_checkpoint=False as no checkpoint by normalizing it to None before checkpoint path handling.
* BART encoder hidden states must be transposed before collection and fed back into later layers so returned batch-first tensors remain ancestors of logits.
* GPT-Neo local attention cached continuations reshape queries and slice mask rows using the current sequence length, not a fixed length of one.
* HfArgumentParser registers true-default positive bool flags before no_* flags, with no_* action default False so CLI help shows unambiguous defaults.
* Wav2Vec2 direct padding must convert Python and NumPy float64 input_values to float32 before framework tensor conversion, while preserving float16.
* Generation rejects prompts at or above max_length with ValueError and recommends max_new_tokens, preventing misleading one-token output.
* BertTokenizerFast must synchronize tokenize_chinese_chars to backend BertNormalizer.handle_chinese_chars when loading tokenizer JSON.
* This Transformers base requires tokenizers` via `TO_LANGUAGE_CODE.values()`.
* Whisper get_prompt_ids prefixes stripped prompt text with an explicit space so slow and fast tokenizers share behavior without add_prefix_space.
* Wav2Vec2 batching treats shaped inputs with rank >1 as batched and splits their first axis before sequence padding.
* GenerationConfig.from_dict must instantiate from config_dict first, then apply kwargs via update so explicit overrides win and unknown kwargs remain reportable.
* When redirecting RTK git diff to a patch file, use --no-compact; compacted output can omit headers and produce an invalid patch.
* RTK git diff redirected to a file may omit the final newline; validate with git apply --check and regenerate with direct git diff if corrupt.
* A timed-out RTK git clone may leave a child process running; verify HEAD again before patch generation and reset to the requested base if it moved.
* After cherry-pick --no-commit, use git reset and git add -N for new files so plain git diff captures the complete patch.
* When creating a nested Git repo inside another repo, run `git init` with the nested absolute path to avoid reinitializing the parent repository.

    This model inherits from [`FlaxPreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a Flax Linen
    [flax.nn.Module](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/flax.nn.module.html) subclass. Use it as a
    regular Flax Module and refer to the Flax documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

    Finally, this model supports inherent JAX features such as:

    - [Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#just-in-time-compilation-jit)
    - [Automatic Differentiation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#automatic-differentiation)
    - [Vectorization](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#vectorization-vmap)
    - [Parallelization](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#parallelization-pmap)

    Parameters:
        config ([`GPT2Config`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~FlaxPreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.
        dtype (`jax.numpy.dtype`, *optional*, defaults to `jax.numpy.float32`):
            The data type of the computation. Can be one of `jax.numpy.float32`, `jax.numpy.float16` (on GPUs) and
            `jax.numpy.bfloat16` (on TPUs).

            This can be used to enable mixed-precision training or half-precision inference on GPUs or TPUs. If
            specified all the computation will be performed with the given `dtype`.

            **Note that this only specifies the dtype of the computation and does not influence the dtype of model
            parameters.**

            If you wish to change the dtype of the model parameters, see [`~FlaxPreTrainedModel.to_fp16`] and
            [`~FlaxPreTrainedModel.to_bf16`].

## Final Response

## Fix

Updated Flax GPT-2 generation to cast boolean attention masks to `int32` before updating the extended attention mask.

## 📝 Files Modified

- [modeling_flax_gpt2.py](src/transformers/models/gpt2/modeling_flax_gpt2.py) — Supports boolean generation attention masks. **+3 −1 lines**

## 📁 Files Created

- [huggingface__transformers-25636.patch](/Users/sankanum1/Documents/SWEPolyBenchRuns/R2VerifiedGPT5.6Sol/running-env2/swe-results/huggingface__transformers-25636.patch) — Required production-only patch artifact. **+15 −0 lines**

## Validation

- Python compilation: passed
- Git whitespace validation: passed
- Patch application against pristine index: passed
- Patch contains only the intended production file; no tests or test artifacts
- Runtime smoke test unavailable because JAX is not installed in the benchmark environment
