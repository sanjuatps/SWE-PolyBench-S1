The current working directory is already provisioned by the benchmark host at exactly the task base commit, with one reachable commit and no Git remotes. Work only in this isolated local source tree.

Do not add Git remotes, clone, fetch, or pull. Do not access GitHub, GitHub APIs, upstream pull requests, commits, patches, or issue solutions. Do not use curl/wget or web-search tools. The benchmark runtime blocks outbound tools and commands.

Fix the issue using only the problem statement and the isolated local source tree. Generate serverless__serverless-6261.patch from the git diff,verify that git diff serverless__serverless-6261.patch contains only implementation or production files and no test files or test artifacts and then place it at this exact path: /Users/sankanum1/Documents/SWEPolyBenchRuns/R2VerifiedGPT5.6Sol/running-env/swe-results/serverless__serverless-6261.patch.

Problem: Load plugin from path

# This is a Feature Proposal

## Description

At the moment we can load plugins like this:

```yaml
plugins:
  - plugin1
  - plugin2
```

or in a specific directory:

```yaml
plugins:
  localPath: './custom_serverless_plugins'
  modules:
    - plugin1
    - plugin2
```

However this changes the directory for all plugins.

It would be very useful to be able to include a module using a relative path:

```yaml
plugins:
  - plugin1
  - plugin2
  - src/foo/bar/plugin3
```

**UPDATE: the final syntax will be:**

```yaml
plugins:
  - plugin1
  - plugin2
  - ./src/foo/bar/plugin3
```

## Use case

My use case is that I want to distribute my plugin without NPM (it is a plugin for a serverless PHP framework, so the plugin will be distributed with the rest of the PHP source code). Because of that I want users to be able to include the plugin, yet don't mess up their "localPath" just for this specific plugin.

## Agent Execution Steps

1. **Tool call: register_tools**
Input:
```json
{
  "tool_names": [
    "get_agent_memory",
    "get_workspace_files_list",
    "read_file",
    "grep",
    "find_files",
    "run_terminal_command",
    "edit_file",
    "write_file",
    "add_agent_memory"
  ],
  "toolPurpose": "- I want to inspect the isolated repository and required `.env` context, identify the plugin-loading implementation and tests, implement the production-only fix, run local quality checks, and generate the requested patch artifact."
}
```
Output:
```
Tools [get_agent_memory, get_workspace_files_list, read_file, grep, find_files, run_terminal_command, edit_file, write_file, add_agent_memory] are now registered and immediately available for usage.
```

2. **Tool call: get_agent_memory**
Input:
```json
{
  "toolPurpose": "- I want to read prior execution context and persistent workspace learnings before inspecting or changing the repository, so I avoid duplicate work and respect established project conventions."
}
```
Output:
```
Successfully read agent memory content:
Learnings from previous agent sessions: Successfully loaded 158 memory entries. Use these to inform your work and avoid creating duplicate memories when calling `add_agent_memory` tool.
Loaded memories:
* Gson JsonReader reports malformed Unicode escapes through syntaxError, yielding MalformedJsonException with line, column, and JSON path context.
* Gson Excluder handles anonymous/non-static local classes directionally: serialization delegates normally, while deserialization remains excluded.
* RocketMQ consumer lag, inflight, and available-message aggregates must iterate TopicConfig read queues to match consumer progress semantics.
* Dubbo's MulticastRegistry.java uses CRLF; validate its diffs with Git core.whitespace=cr-at-eol to avoid false trailing-whitespace failures.
* Gson tests on JDK 26 need -Pjdk15, release 8, ProGuard skipped, and ReflectionAccessTest excluded due removed SecurityManager support.
* Apollo namespace validation rejects URI-reserved names `.` and `..` while allowing ordinary dotted names.
* Gson production links to repository documentation should use the `main` branch in GitHub blob URLs.
* Gson ISO8601Utils uses a separate date-only GregorianCalendar path; it must disable leniency just like the date-time path to reject impossible dates.
* Apollo Portal password fragments are configured by apollo.portal.auth.password-checker.commonly-used-passwords-file and re-read on each check.
* Gson JsonWriter.name must immediately reject calls outside EMPTY_OBJECT or NONEMPTY_OBJECT with IllegalStateException("Nesting problem.").
* Dubbo RpcUtils priority is method-specific invocation attachment, generic attachment, URL method config, then URL global config.
* Gson ConstructorConstructor special-cases EnumMap, constructing it from a parameterized Class key and rejecting invalid raw/non-Class key types.
* Gson's unsafe opt-out API is disableJdkUnsafe(); its state must survive Gson.newBuilder() and fail lazily with JsonIOException when no constructor exists.
* Gson's JsonAdapter annotation factory must precede collection and map factories so unregistered annotation factories can obtain those delegates.
* Gson Streams.AppendableWriter.CurrentWrite must override toString() to return its full backing char array for CharSequence-compliant Appendables.
* Gson FormattingStyle separator spacing uses withSpaceAfterSeparators(boolean) and usesSpaceAfterSeparators(); commas are spaced only when newline is empty.
* Dubbo ClassHelper.convertPrimitive returns null for null or empty string input before primitive parsing.
* Gson Maven on JDK 26 fails -Werror on $Gson$Types dangling doc comments; direct javac --release 8 can validate production compilation locally.
* Gson serializes LazilyParsedNumber via an exact built-in adapter registered before reflective fallback, preserving its numeric lexeme.
* Guava concurrency production changes often require mirrored edits in guava/src and android/guava/src.
* Gson JsonObject backs members with LinkedTreeMap configured to reject Java null values, including through Map.Entry.setValue.
* Gson ProtoTypeAdapter supports opt-in explicit protobuf json_name via setShouldUseJsonNameFieldOption; custom serialized-name extensions take precedence.
* Apollo Portal forbids creating a private AppNamespace when the same name is already a globally public AppNamespace.
* Gson primitive numeric adapters must call the matching Number conversion method before serialization, including float/double and long-string policy wrappers.
* Dubbo compatibility tests on JDK 26 need JaCoCo skipped and java.lang opened; full tests may still fail when sandbox socket binding is denied.
* RocketMQ broker send ingress must strip PROPERTY_POP_CK so forwarded POP messages receive a fresh destination-broker receipt handle.
* Guava TopKSelector's trim fallback sorts an inclusive [left, right] range, so Arrays.sort must receive right + 1 as its exclusive bound.
* Gson DefaultDateTypeAdapter must restore each cached DateFormat timezone in a finally block after every parse attempt.
* Dubbo MockInvoker caches must include the service interface in the key; shorthand mock values like true/default are shared across references.
* At Gson base fe30b85, Gson.newJsonWriter must call setHtmlSafe(htmlSafe) so adapter-driven integrations inherit default or disabled HTML escaping.
* Gson's Troubleshooting.md uses CRLF; run Git whitespace checks with core.whitespace=cr-at-eol.
* Apollo Portal local user administration uses a super-admin /users/admin endpoint and UserInfo.enabled; edits preserve blank passwords and persist enabled status.
* RocketMQ POP retry topic v2 uses `%RETRY%group+topic`; `+` is forbidden in topic/group names, while v1 uses `_`.
* Dubbo CompatibleTypeUtils parses LocalDateTime as yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss, LocalDate as yyyy-MM-dd, and LocalTime as HH:mm:ss.
* Dubbo Bytes char[] Base64 decoding must decrement full quartets and set remainder to 2/3 when the final quartet contains padding.
* Dubbo Triple Connection must assign the successful ChannelFuture channel in ConnectionListener before immediate availability checks.
* This Dubbo base contains multiple CRLF Java files; use git -c core.whitespace=cr-at-eol diff --check for rename-only patches.
* RocketMQ TieredFlatFile LOWER time lookup selects earliest segment with maxTimestamp >= target; UPPER selects latest with minTimestamp  instances, from shadowing it.
* Three.js Quaternion and Euler rotation-matrix conversion uses a 3-column stride for Matrix3 and 4-column stride for Matrix4 column-major elements.
* Svelte 1.17 static each-else teardown must set the destroyed else block reference to null so later empty states recreate it.
* Svelte v1 input value generation may tolerate dynamic type attributes, while binding semantics still require a compile-time static input type.
* At Svelte 1.14.1 base ec543cf, missing expected data properties are emitted by src/generators/dom/index.js as dev-only generated constructor diagnostics.
* Svelte v1 CSS attribute-presence selectors must return true once the attribute exists, before looking up a matcher operator.
* Svelte v1 component binding observers in keyed each blocks must reconstruct used contextual values from the child component's current _context before setting parent state.
* Svelte 1.27 CSS preprocessing is centralized in Stylesheet.apply for both DOM and SSR native elements, before selector matching and code generation.
* Svelte v1 Generator.parseJs must preserve node.async when lifting function expressions and arrow functions into named declarations.
* RocketMQ QueueOffsetAssigner uses get-before-computeIfAbsent fast paths to avoid Java 8 JDK-8161372 contention for established queue keys.
* Dubbo AbstractConfig metadata must prefer getX over duplicate isX accessors because Class.getMethods order is unspecified.
* Trino AddLocalExchanges should propagate parent stream preferences through identity projects to avoid redundant local repartition/gather exchanges around pruning.
* This benchmark workspace has no locally installed Java runtime, so Maven tests cannot run.
* In this Trino base, ProjectNode.isIdentity also identifies symbol-preserving pruning because Assignments checks only retained output assignments.
* Svelte v1 SSR must initialize a component-defined store inside `_render`, because nested components bypass the public `render` wrapper.
* Svelte v1 event handlers must serialize await contexts directly; each contexts instead serialize list/index pairs for reconstruction.
* Svelte v1 SVG attribute casing warnings are implemented in src/validate/html/validateElement.ts and scoped to SVG elements, descendants, and SVG namespace builds.
* Svelte v1 oncreate callbacks use unshift registration with LIFO callAll draining to preserve component/template preorder.
* Svelte v1 CSS scoping must merge the generated scope class into static and dynamic class values across DOM, innerHTML, and SSR output.
* Svelte v1 await then/catch context aliases must use Block.getUniqueName so names like children cannot shadow hydration helpers.
* Svelte v1 static innerHTML attribute serialization must join all text chunks so appended scoped CSS classes are not dropped on nested elements.
* Svelte v1 CSS DCE must treat Spread attributes as potential sources of any missing class, ID, or attribute during selector matching.
* Svelte v2 custom DOM event handlers must rewrite a direct `this.method()` callee to the associated element variable; native events retain runtime `this` binding.
* Svelte v3 alpha native element binding handlers emitted in component.partly_hoisted must use component.getUniqueName, not block.getUniqueName.
* Svelte v3 alpha rewrite_props must add a semicolon when exported prop declarations rely on ASI, while preserving an existing declaration semicolon.
* Svelte assignment instrumentation must ignore member roots that are not Identifiers; ThisExpression roots otherwise emit $$invalidate('undefined', undefined).
* Svelte v3 file-input bindings should listen to `change`, not `input`, because Safari does not reliably emit `input` when files are selected.
* Svelte v3 Expression.render must prefix hoisted object-method replacements with `: ` when the parent Property has method=true.
* Svelte v3 SSR inline-component attributes must use quote_name_if_necessary in both direct props and Object.assign spread fragments.
* Svelte mutation tracking must classify UpdateExpression member targets as mutated, not reassigned, in scripts and inline template functions.
* Svelte v3 Element namespace inference must stop at InlineComponent boundaries so slotted SVG tags do not inherit an outer HTML element namespace.
* Svelte inline !important styles are compiled by stripping the priority token and passing true as set_style's optional fourth argument.
* Svelte DebugTag DOM generation must omit its update block when expression dependencies are empty, or it emits invalid `if ()` code.
* Svelte v3 reassigned function declarations must remain unhoisted and count as dynamic reactive dependencies via Var.reassigned.
* In Svelte 3.9.1, reactive extraction and DOM dirty-check filtering must both include reassigned bindings; reassigned functions must not be hoisted.
* At Svelte base 64c56edd, reassigned function declarations must not hoist and must be included in reactive dependency and DOM dirty filters.
* Svelte v3 outro-capable compound if blocks must avoid changed([]); cached call conditions without dependencies use only a null initialization guard.
* Svelte 3.14 add_resize_listener creates an object resize sensor; set aria-hidden=true so this implementation detail is excluded from the accessibility tree.
* Svelte hydration must iterate a live NamedNodeMap backwards when removing unexpected attributes, or forward deletion skips alternating entries.
* Svelte CSS matching must distinguish unknown dynamic attributes from definite matches so leading :global descendants are not spuriously scoped.
* Svelte 3 keyed each updates must reassign the outer each_block_value so {:else} observes the current list length.
* Svelte v3 dev unknown-prop allowlists must include all instance exports, not only writable exports, because exported functions participate in component bindings.
* Svelte store-first destructuring must pass tail invalidations as extra set_store_value arguments so all store setters are evaluated while preserving the assignment result.
* Svelte await outros must clear info.blocks[i] only if the slot still references the outgoing block, so delayed callbacks cannot erase newer branches.
* Svelte v3 actions are repeatable directives; parser uniqueness checks exempt both EventHandler and Action while retaining other directive checks.
* Svelte 3 slot spreads require ordered Object.assign slot data and a wildcard dirty flag so arbitrary added, changed, or removed slot props update consumers.
* Svelte v3 SSR bound attributes must use boolean_attributes metadata; hard-coding boolean=true causes bind:value={0} to be omitted.
* Svelte hydratable builds map append, insert, and HtmlTag to hydration-specific helpers so plain bundles tree-shake hydration reordering.
* Svelte slot revival after an outro must pass an all-dirty mask to slot helpers; overflow contexts need one -1 per 31-member group.
* Svelte 3 await shorthand supports omitted resolve context by closing `then` with `}`, leaving the parsed await value null while activating the then branch.
* Svelte component initialization must prefer explicit options.context over ambient parent context, while cloning the selected map.
* Svelte text-like input update guards must include type=search in Attribute, Binding, and spread-attribute Element compiler paths.
* Prettier HTML embedded parsing depends on isScriptLikeTag; SVG script elements use fullName "svg:script" and must be included alongside "svg:style".
* Svelte 3 KeyBlock DOM wrappers must register key expression dependencies on the containing Block so slot-owned keyed fragments receive dirty updates.
* Prettier's TypeScript TSEnumMember printer must wrap `id` with brackets when `node.computed` is true.
* Prettier CLI directory globs must reuse an existing trailing slash; adding another slash causes fast-glob to return no supported files.
* Prettier SCSS @use/@forward `with (` spacing is handled in the value-comma_group branch of src/language-css/printer-postcss.js.
* Prettier ignored-node printing preserves relative indentation by comparing the node's leading whitespace with its nearest leading comment.
* Prettier ignored-node raw printing must mark only comments within the node range; file-wide prettier-ignore exemptions hide unrelated dropped comments.
* Prettier nested TSParenthesizedType keeps one pair in TSConditionalType check/extends and TSIndexedAccessType object positions.
* Prettier babel-ts must rethrow selected Babel recovered errors inside tryCombinations so invalid AST nodes do not reach the printer and fallback still runs.
* Prettier Markdown footnote definitions must flatten the initial paragraph with removeLines so long content remains attached to the `[^id]:` marker.
* Prettier config resolves string plugins and pluginSearchDirs relative to the discovered config file, including selected override options.
* Prettier's PostCSS root printer must return an empty string when css-root.nodes is empty; hardline is only for non-empty CSS/SCSS/Less roots.
* Prettier base 69f6ee7 is provisioned without node_modules; local CLI/tests fail on missing minimist unless dependencies are supplied.
* Prettier v1 CLI write status is emitted in src/cli-util.js formatFiles; silent loglevel must gate TTY progress, duration lines, and separators.
* Prettier 0.16 JSX opening tags keep `>` with the final prop by using an empty doc after non-self-closing attributes; self-closing tags retain `line` before `/>`.
* This Prettier 0.16 workspace lacks node_modules; full formatter and Jest tests are blocked by missing babel-code-frame and jest.
* Prettier 0.16 stabilizes standalone ternary boundary comments by attaching them as trailing comments to the preceding conditional child.
* Prettier v0.11 prints ClassProperty, ClassMethod, and MethodDefinition decorators with spaces; class decorators remain line-separated.
* Prettier 0.0.10 must print ExportDefaultSpecifier and ExportNamespaceSpecifier outside braces to preserve export-extension semantics.
* This Prettier workspace has no node_modules; Jest and formatter smoke tests are blocked by missing local dependencies.
* Serverless API Gateway custom request templates use null values to remove matching default content-type templates during compilation.
* Serverless v1.68 REST API http event properties pass through validation; AWS::ApiGateway::Method properties are built in apiGateway/lib/method/index.js.
* Serverless `.serverlessrc` may be symlinked; file detection must follow valid symlinks to avoid recreating the config and resetting tracking preferences.
* This Serverless workspace is provisioned without node_modules, so Mocha and ESLint quality gates cannot run locally.
* Serverless AWS info resource counts must paginate listStackResources via NextToken and accumulate StackResourceSummaries across all pages.
* SNS redrive queue policies need Fn::GetAtt for the queue ARN and Ref for the queue URL; the config may identify the queue by logical resource name.
* This Serverless benchmark tree has no installed npm dependencies, so unit tests and lint are blocked; Node syntax checks remain available.
* Serverless provisioned concurrency should live on a `provisioned` Lambda alias targeting the content-hashed version; API Gateway must invoke and permit that alias ARN.
* Serverless v1.54 IAM statements are validated in mergeIamTemplates.js and then concatenated unchanged into the generated execution-role policy.
* Serverless REST API logging treats exact SSM string "false" as disabled at stage compilation and post-deploy stage updates.
* Serverless CloudWatch Logs events need indexed Lambda permission IDs and each permission SourceArn scoped to its event's exact log group.
* Serverless IAM logging adds the service-stage wildcard only when a resolved function name uses that canonical prefix; manual-only services get exact log ARNs.
* When redirecting RTK git diff to a patch file, use --no-compact; compacted output can omit headers and produce an invalid patch.
* RTK git diff redirected to a file may omit the final newline; validate with git apply --check and regenerate with direct git diff if corrupt.
* A timed-out RTK git clone may leave a child process running; verify HEAD again before patch generation and reset to the requested base if it moved.
* After cherry-pick --no-commit, use git reset and git add -N for new files so plain git diff captures the complete patch.
* When creating a nested Git repo inside another repo, run `git init` with the nested absolute path to avoid reinitializing the parent repository.

17. **Tool call: add_agent_memory**
Input:
```json
{
  "memories": [
    {
      "content": "Serverless service plugins beginning with ./ or ../ resolve from serverless.config.servicePath; package names retain normal Node resolution.",
      "scope": "workspace"
    }
  ],
  "toolPurpose": "- I want to preserve the implemented plugin-resolution contract as a concise workspace-specific architectural fact for future maintenance without storing temporary execution details."
}
```
Output:
```
Processed 1 memory item(s): 1 stored, 0 skipped (duplicates), 0 failed.
```

## Final Response

## Summary

Relative plugin paths beginning with `./` or `../` now resolve from the Serverless service directory. Package-name resolution and `localPath` behavior remain unchanged.

## 📝 Files Modified

- [PluginManager.js](lib/classes/PluginManager.js) - Resolves explicit relative plugin paths against `servicePath`. **+3 −1 lines**

## 📁 Files Created

- [serverless__serverless-6261.patch](../swe-results/serverless__serverless-6261.patch) - Generated patch at the required location. **+3 −1 lines**

## Verification

- JavaScript syntax check: passed
- Git whitespace validation: passed
- Patch application check: passed
- Patch exactly matches the Git diff
- Diff contains only the production file [PluginManager.js](lib/classes/PluginManager.js); no tests or test artifacts
- Unit tests blocked because `mocha` is not installed
- Lint blocked because `eslint` is not installed
